    %   market conditions by integrating recent trend, reversal potential and
    %   historical risk to calculate investment potential scores and model parameters.
    %
    %   This function is a core component of the Investment Potential Tracking (IPT)
    %   model, implementing the three-state selection strategy. It dynamically selects
    %   appropriate investment strategies based on overall market risk levels and outputs
    %   corresponding investment potential scores and model parameters Q_{t+1}.
